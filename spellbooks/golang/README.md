## Golang `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`

### Usage

See the [top-level README](../../README.md) for complete usage instructions.

1. In the first few lines of the build script, change `PROJECT_PATH=`, `INJECT_PACKAGE_PATH=`, and `FILE_NAME=` to reflect your project.
1. Later on in the file, change `PROJECT_PATH=`, and `FILE_NAME=` to match those used in step #1.

Also recommended:
1. Update `.dockerignore` to include project-specific ignores.
